# Sinatra starter app

May easily be used as an app template for working on sinatra apps

```
$ bundle install
```

```
$ ruby app.rb
```

To use this on [cloud9](http://c9.io), Create a New Workspace by cloning
this repo, and then when it's all done, run `bundle install`, like
usual, but then instead of `ruby app.rb`, you'll need to run it on their
system, with their ip/port configuration, so use:

```
$ ruby app.rb -p $PORT -o $IP
```
